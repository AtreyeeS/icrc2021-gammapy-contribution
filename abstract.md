# Gammapy: a Python Package for Gamma-Ray Astronomy

Gammapy is a community-developed, open source Python package for Gamma-Ray Astronomy. It builts on the scientific Python ecosystem such as Numpy, Scipy and Astropy to implement high level analysis functionality for any counts-based Gamma-Ray data. Starting from event lists and parametristaion of the instrument response it 
supports reduction of data to user selected It also implememnts a varity of background estimation methods for spectral, spatial, combined spectromorphological as well as time analysis.

It supports a variaty of spectral, spatial and temporla models as well as user implemented custom models, e.g. parametrising energy dependent morphology of sources.

It also supports joint likelihood fitting as well has multi-instrument analysis.

In this contribution we present an overview of the most recent features and API along with some example analyses
using H.E.S.S and Fermi-LAT and simulated CTA data. We also outline the general development status and future goals.


Estimation of flux points, flux maps and light curves in energy bands.
