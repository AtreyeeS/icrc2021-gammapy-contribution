# Gammapy: a Python Package for Gamma-Ray Astronomy

Gammapy is a community-developed, open source Python package for Gamma-Ray Astronomy. It builts on the scientific Python ecosystem such as Numpy, Scipy and Astropy. 

I implements high level analysis functionality such as likelihood fitting to Poisson data. 

Starting from event list based data and IRFs it support data reduction and a varity of bacjkground estimation methods for spectral, spatial and combined analyses.

It supports a variaty of spectral, spatial and temporla models as well as user implemented custom models, e.g. parametrising energy dependent morphology of sources.

It also supports joint likelihood fitting as well has multi-instrument analysis.

In this contribution we present an overviwe of the most recent features adnd API, the general developments status as well as example analyses.

Estimation of flux points, flux maps and light curves in energy bands.
